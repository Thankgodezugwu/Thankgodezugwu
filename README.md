- ### [Projects in Progress](https://github.com/Thankgodezugwu?tab=repositories)
  - **Cardiovascular disease analysis and prediction system using Machine Learning Algorithm (In Progress)**
    - This project focuses on the development of a cardiovascular disease analysis and prediction system leveraging machine learning algorithms. By harnessing advanced data analytics techniques, the system aims to accurately assess the risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases and predict the likelihood of occurrence in individuals. Through the utilization of vast datasets and sophisticated algorithms, the project endeavors to enhance early detection and intervention strategies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes and the prevention of cardiovascular-related complications.
  -	**Youtube comments Sentiment Analysis using NLP (In Progress)**
    - This project involves the implementation of sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques on YouTube comments. By extracting insights from user-generated content, the system can gauge the sentiment expressed towards videos or topics, enabling content creators and marketers to better understand audience reception. Beyond YouTube, similar sentiment analysis applications can be applied across various social media platforms, customer reviews, and feedback forums, offering valuable insights for businesses, brand management, market research, and reputation monitoring.

- ### [Proposed Projects](https://github.com/Thankgodezugwu?tab=repositories)
  -	**Identification of the Psychological State of Human Subject using Machine Learning Algorithm (Proposed)**
    - In social interactions, people usually produce subtle signals (verbal and non-verbal) that support interaction and reveal their internal mental states. For example, people use different voice pitches, facial expressions, hand movements, etc. in their communications during conversations to present their inner thinking. By analyzing these signals, a system can identify peopleâ€™s psychological states like mood, desire, anxiety, depression, and so on. The aim of this project is to employ machine learning algorithms to analyze signals collected from human subjects to identify their psychological states.

  - **A smart document summarization system through multi-modal analysis**
    - In today's world, document summarization faces a challenge; the existing methods often miss out on the rich tapestry of information present in documents and videos. They struggle to capture the nuances that make each piece unique. We need a solution that goes beyond mere text analysis, embracing a more intelligent approach. The goal of this project is to create a document summarization system that understands not just words but also images and, potentially, audio. Imagine a world where information is seamlessly distilled, where the essence of documents is captured in all its diversity. This is the challenge this project aim to overcome, forging a path towards a more inclusive and nuanced representation of content, ensuring that vital information is never lost in translation.
